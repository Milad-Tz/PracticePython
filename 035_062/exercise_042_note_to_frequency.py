"""
The following table lists an octave of music notes, beginning with middle C, along with their frequencies:

    Note        Frequency (Hz)
    C4          261.63
    D4          293.66
    E4          329.63
    F4          349.23
    G4          392.00
    A4          440.00
    B4          493.88

Write a program that reads the name of a note from the user and displays the noteâ€™s frequency. The program should also
support notes from C0 to C8 by utilizing the relationship between octaves: the frequency of any note in octave `n` is half
the frequency of the corresponding note in octave `n + 1`.
